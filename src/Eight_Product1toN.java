/**
 * Exercise Product1ToN (Loop): Write a program called Product1ToN to compute
 * the product of integers 1 to 10 (i.e., 123...10). Try computing the
 * product from 1 to 11, 1 to 12, 1 to 13 and 1 to 14. Write down the product
 * obtained and explain the results. Hints: Declare an int variable called
 * product (to accumulate the product) and initialize to 1. Try: Compute the
 * product from 1 to 11, 1 to 12, 1 to 13 and 1 to 14. Write down the product
 * obtained and decide if the results are correct. Try: Repeat the above, but
 * use long to store the product. Compare the products obtained. Hints: Product
 * of 1 to 13 (=6227020800) is outside the range of int [-2147483648,
 * 2147483647], but within the range of long. Take note that computer programs
 * may not produce the correct answer even though everything seems correct!
